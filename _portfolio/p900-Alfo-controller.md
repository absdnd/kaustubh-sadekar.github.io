This was my first project using any micro-controller. I created it in my first year of undergrad studies. I designed and built this gadget
to play my favorite game, NFS Most Wanted, with a single hand.
* ADXL345 accelerometer was used to control the care using hand gestures.
* Aluminium foils were used as switches to enable special commands like NOS, Slow motion, gear transmission, etc.
* Used Arduino Leonardo to augment keyboard key press
