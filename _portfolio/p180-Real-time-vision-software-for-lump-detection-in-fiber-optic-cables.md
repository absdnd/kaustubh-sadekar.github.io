Project in brief
================

A real-time vision based software capable of detecting lumps in fiber optic cables. I used simple and efficent image processing methods to ensure 
low computation and high FPS for the software. Some key points about the software :
* OpenCV based code. Developed python as well as C++ version.
* The software stores a log of time stamp at which each lump is detected. This log helps in avoiding wastage of time in manual inspection for lumps and provides a 
clear estimate of the possible location for lumps in the fiber optic cables.
