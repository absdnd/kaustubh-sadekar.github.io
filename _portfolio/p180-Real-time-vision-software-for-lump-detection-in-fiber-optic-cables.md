Project in brief
================

A real-time vision-based software capable of detecting lumps in fiber optic cables. I used simple and efficient image processing methods to ensure low computation and high FPS for the software. Some key points about the software :
* OpenCV based code. Developed python as well as a C++ version.
* The software stores a log of timestamps at which each lump is detected. This log helps avoid wastage of time in manual inspection for lumps and provides a precise estimate of the possible location for lumps in the fiber optic cables.
