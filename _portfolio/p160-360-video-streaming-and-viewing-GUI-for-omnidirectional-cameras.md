Project in brief
================

As a side project, using various concepts that I have been using for my research on omnidirectional cameras, I developed my own software to view 360&deg; videos and images using OpenCV. The software was designed from scratch after understanding the mathematics related to 360&deg; videos. Some key points of the project are mentioned below :
* Real-time streaming using an omnidirectional camera.
* Flask server to convert the image from the stream and provide 360&deg; pan view.
* App interface to view the 360&deg; video with GUI that enables the user to pan the view.
* Software supports horizontal(parallel to the ground) as well as vertical(perpendicular to the ground) orientation of the streaming camera.
