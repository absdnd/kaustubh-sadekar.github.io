Project in brief
================

A lage amount of information of our past is hand written. Hence it is a common practice to understand the content in such hand written documents.
Constant attempts are being made to understand the content in such hand written documents using computer vision and deep learning.
It has been observed that these pages have different types of ruled lines and texture. These attributes act as noise to deep learning models 
used to understand content written in the documents. Thus several attempts have been made by researchers to segment only the content that was 
written by hand and eliminate the page lines and texture. I have developed a CNN to perform this task.Some key points of the project are as follows:

* CNN based model trained from scratch.
* Model can segment the hand written content from different types of pages.
* Next attempt is to improve the model performance on various public datasets.
