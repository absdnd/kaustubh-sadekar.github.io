Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisibility cloak. Well it turns out that using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my childhood fantasy.

Project in brief
================

This was a fun project I developed using concepts of HSV based color segmentation.
* Used a red color cloth
* Segmented the cloth using red color segmentation with OpenCV
* Replaced background pixels for the mask corresponding to the red color cloth making it invisible.

It was my first OpenCV project and it went viral and I also got a chance to write a detailed blog on this project for a famous website LearOpenCV.org
