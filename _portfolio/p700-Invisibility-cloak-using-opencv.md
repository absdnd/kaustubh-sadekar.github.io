Being a harry potter fan, I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisibility cloak. It turns out that I can now fulfill my childhood fantasy using simple image processing tricks.

Project in brief
================

This was a fun project I developed using concepts of HSV based color segmentation.
* Used a red color cloth
* Segmented the cloth using red color segmentation with OpenCV
* Replaced background pixels for the mask corresponding to the red color cloth, making it invisible.

It was my first OpenCV project, and it went viral. I also got a chance to write a detailed blog on this project for a famous website LearnOpenCV.org founded by Dr. Satya Mallick - The interim CEO of OpenCV.
