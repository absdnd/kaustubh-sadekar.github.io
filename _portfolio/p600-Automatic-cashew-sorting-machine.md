Project in brief
================


This was my final year project. The project included developing vision software for size and shape-based classification of cashew kernels and developing a working prototype of the entire machine. Some key features of the project are as follows:
* Design and fabrication of the sorting machine. Created a cost friendly conveyor mechanism.
* Design of MOSFET based DC motor controller for speed control of the conveyor belt.
* Using a calibrated camera at a fixed height, size-based sorting of cashew kernels was developed.
* Using Hu moments, extent, solidity, and extent as features, full and broken cashew classification was done.
