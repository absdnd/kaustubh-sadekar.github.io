Project in brief
================


This was my final year project. The project not only included developing vision software for size and shape based classification of cashew kernels, but also included 
developing a working prototype of the entire machine. Some key features of the project are mentioned below.
* Design and fabrication of the sorting machine. Created a cost firendly conveyor mechanism.
* Design of MOSFET based DC motor controller for speed control of the conveyor belt.
* Using a caliberated camera at a fixed height, size based sorting of cashew kernels was developed.
* Using Hu moments, extent, solidity and extent as features classification of full and broken cashew was done.
