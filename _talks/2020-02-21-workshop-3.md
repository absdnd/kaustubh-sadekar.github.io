As an active alumnus of the robotics club, Cretus, I, along with the present student members of Cretus, planned a 3 parter 48 hour course for the present student to give them a good head start 
so they can create thei own projects and participate in robotics competetions and also get involved in research.

This was the **third workshop of the three parter workshop series**. A detailed introduction to ROS was given to the students. It covered all the basic components 
of ROS and later students were taught to make their own ROS nodes. At the end several robotic systems were discussed with an idea of possible ROS project structure.

The aim of this workshop was to start a new culture of using ROS for robotics projects in our university.

* Introduction to ROS
  * Why is ROS needed
  * Real life applications of ROS
