Delivered a workshop of 16 Hours on raspberry pi and computer vision.
60 Students participated in the workshop and had little or no knowledge of raspberry pi or computer vision.

My methodology of teaching during a workshop is that I simply explain the theory and provide basic building blocks.Then I let the students work on some fun projects and challenges using these building blocks.

Topics covered in the workshop
==============================

* Basics of python
  * Printing 
  * Variables
  * Taking user inputs
  * Lists
  * Dictionaries
  * Loops
  * Creating user defined functions
* Basics of linux terminal commands
* Raspberry Pi basics
  * GPIO operations of raspberry pi with python
  * Controling GPIO pins 
  * Taking inputs from GPIO pins
  * Debouncing of a switch
  * PWM signals on RPi GPIO
  * Controling servo
* Fundamentals of image formation
* OpenCV basic image reading, writing
* Types of color spaces
* Accessing and indexing pixel values of an image
* Color detection
* Canny edge detection (basic theory and code)
* Haar cascade theory
* Face detection using haar cascade.

Based on the building blocks explained in the workshop the participants were able to build several interesting projects with little or no guidance. Some of the projects are :

* Sketch effect using canny edge detection.
* Specific LED lights up when corresponding color is shown to the web cam.
* Invisibility cloak.
* Face tracking webcam
