As an active alumnus of the robotics club, Cretus, I, along with the present student members of Cretus, planned a 3 parter 48 hour course for the present student to give them a good head start 
so they can create thei own projects and participate in robotics competetions and also get involved in research.

This was the second workshop of the three parter workshop series. Some of the fundamental concepts and theories related to computer vision were explained with hands-on experience.

Topics covered in the workshop
==============================

* Different types of thresholding methods - Theory and implimentation in opencv as well as only using Numpy
* Interfaceing push button with raspberry pi. Understanding bouncing of switch and writing a debouncing software from scratch.
* Controling servo motors using raspberry pi.
* Face tracking and following camera.
* Convolution.
* Image gradients and designing sobel, pewitt and laplacian filters.
* Designing bluring filters.
* Understanding image remapping.
* Contours in OpenCV.
* Understanding some key concepts used for document preprocessing.
* Text recognition using Tesseract OCR engine.
