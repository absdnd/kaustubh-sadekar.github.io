I am a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am currently designing a robust computer vision pipeline that tightly couples concepts of SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping), video stabilization, object detection, and image enhancement, for a robotic system to be used in indoor surveillance activities.
