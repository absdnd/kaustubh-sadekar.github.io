I am a Research Associate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. It's quite facinating for me that using math and computer programing we can make a machine understand what its eyes(the cameras) are able to see(capture)!! I am currently designing a roboust computer vision pipeline which tightly couples concepts of SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping), video stabilization and image enhancement, for a robotic system with non-linear dynamics.
