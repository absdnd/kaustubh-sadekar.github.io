I am a Research Associate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. It's quite facinating for me that using math and computer programing we can make a machine understand what its eyes(the cameras) are able to see(capture)!! I am currently designing a roboust computer vision pipeline which tightly couples concepts of SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping), video stabilization and image enhancement, for a robotic system with non-linear dynamics.

{% include feature_row %}

[Autonomous Goods Management Robotic System](portfolio/p4-autonomous-goods-management-system/)
Developed a prototype of autonomous goods management robotic system. The project was awarded 3rd position at IEEE-IAS Internation Students Robotics Demonstration Competetion and represented India at world finals held in Portlan,USA.

[TEEVRA Electric Car](portfolio/p5-teevra-electric-car/) 
As part of team Kaizen, developed a real scale prototype electric car and secured 16th rank in Asia at Shell Eco-Marathon Asia 2017 held in Singapore. I developed the code for the power electronic of  BLDC motor of the electric car.

[SPARK - A Robotic Sketching Arm](portfolio/p1-spark-robotic-sketching-arm/) 
A self designed 3DOF robotic arm capable of sketching any image given as input. The robot was developed using ROS and OpenCV.

[Computer vision based cashew sorting machine](portfolio/p2-cashew-sorting-machine/) 
Self designed and fabricated machine capable of classifying and sorting full and broken cashews using ROS and OpenCV implimented on Raspberry Pi. 

[Computer vision based algorithm for lump detection in optic fiber cables](portfolio/p3-lump-detection-algorithm/)
Designed a custom algotihm for detection of lumps in fibre optic cables for a company. The software was written using OpenCV.
