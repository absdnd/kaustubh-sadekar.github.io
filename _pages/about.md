I am a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am currently designing a robust computer vision pipeline that tightly couples concepts of SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping), video stabilization, object detection, and image enhancement, for a robotic system to be used in indoor surveillance activities. 


Experience
==========
- **Research Associate** Indian Institute of Technology Bombay *(May 2019 - Ongoing)* 
  - Developed a real-time surveillance system capable of streaming live pan 360&deg; video feedback along with a 360&deg; viewing software to enable the user to pan the view while operating the surveillance robot.
  - Studied, analyzed and tested the performance of various monocular Visual SLAM algorithms using omnidirectional cameras.
  - Studied and implemented various camera models for omnidirectional cameras.
  - Studied about object detection methods for omnidirectional cameras.
  - Worked on a video stabilization algorithm.

- **Computer Vision Software Developer** GeekyBee AI pvt.ltd *(July 2018 - May 2019)*
  - Designed algorithms and developed software in C++ and Python for various image processing, computer vision, and 3D reconstruction projects.
  - Developed custom vision-based quality assessment software in C++ and Python using OpenCV to assess the quality of road markings and pavement markings.
  - Developed software for automatic number plate recognition for number plates of different countries.
  - 3D reconstruction software using concepts of Multi-View-Geometry and structure from motion.
  - Pre-processing pipeline for OCR of printed documents.

- **Computer Vision Intern** Technosamarthyam *(December 2017- June -2018)*
  - Developed software for lump-detection in fiber optic cable using image processing.
